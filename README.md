A third party tool for Elite Dangerous developed with GodotEngine.

## Features
- A journal reader that allows to see each entry in a nicer view.
- A Query builder that allows to query the database with certain degree of freedom. Data can be represented as a table or in the galaxy map.
- A galaxy map with data represented in 3D (lot of potential and where most of my efforts were directed).
- A very early view representing your ships and its statistics.

It is still a WIP, and I'm looking for collaborators, feel free to fork and PR.


# Credits
Below the individuals and companies I have to credit:
- Frontier Developmen, for making this fantastic game and the journals ED generates
- CMDR Qohen Leth for the 2D map overlay
